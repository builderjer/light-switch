# light-switch
My own personal version of a smart switch for my smart home concept [Ziggy](https://github.com/builderjer/ZiggyAI)

## Concept
While I could spend the money and buy smart switches for each room, but they dont neccesaraly have all of the functions or capabalities that I want.  And they are expensive!!  I think that I can build one for WAYYYYY less.

I have tihe idea of using a small tablet or simple cheap phone as an interface.  This way it can display a webpage from my server and interface from that.
